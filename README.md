# Dimensionality reduction methods comparison

The goal of this workflow is to compare the behaviour of different dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE, UMAP or flowSOM.

Its main source of inspiration is [this great blog post from Nikolay Oskolkov](https://towardsdatascience.com/tsne-vs-umap-global-structure-4d8045acba17), that we extended to other methods used in flow cytometry.
